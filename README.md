# Rockbuster_SQL

A data analysis project for CareerFoundry using PostgreSQL to analyze data from a fictional movie rental company, Rockbuster Stealth. 

## Background 
Rockbuster Stealth LLC is a movie rental company that used to have stores around the
world. Facing stiff competition from streaming services such as Netflix and Amazon Prime, the Rockbuster Stealth management team is planning to use its existing movie licenses to launch an online video rental service in order to stay competitive.

## Objectives and Key Questions

As a data analyst for Rockbuster Stealth’s business intelligence (BI)
department, my task was to help with the launch strategy for the new online video service. The BI department helps other departments, from inventory to customer insights, with data-related queries. 

The Rockbuster Stealth Management Board has asked a series of business questions and
they expect data-driven answers that they can use for their 2020 company strategy. Here are
the main questions they’d like to answer:

  ● Which movies contributed the most/least to revenue gain?

  ● What was the average rental duration for all videos?

  ● Which countries are Rockbuster customers based in?

  ● Where are customers with a high lifetime value based?

  ● Do sales figures vary between geographic regions?

## Data 

A relational database made up of 15 tables containing data on rental payments, films, customers, etc. Descriptions of tables and entity relationship diagram can be found in the Rockbuster Data Dictionary here. Visualizations for this project can be found on Tableau here. 

## Tools 

Language: PostgreSQL
Software: pgAdmin, Lucidchart, Tableau, Excel 

## Skills Demonstrated 

**Creating Entity Relationship Diagram:** Created with Lucidchart 

**Filtering Data:** Filtered using where, having, and case statments 

**Cleaning Data:** Used SQL queries to find duplicate date, incorrect data, non-uniform data, and missing data 

**Joining Tables:** Selected inner, outer, left, or right joins in ordre to minimize time and memory needed 

**Descriptive Statistics:** Performed basic statstics (mean, min, max, mode) for variables 

**Subqueries and Common Table Expressions (CTE's):** Created subqueries and CTE's to make code more readable, easier to reuse, and minimize time and memory needed 

**Reporting Results:** A Powerpoint presentation with visualizations from Tableau to answer key questions and make recommendations.
